title: "How to build your network."

Notes based on my reading of
[this HBR article](https://hbr.org/2005/12/how-to-build-your-network) by Brian
Uzzi and Shannon Dunlap.

* **Correlation between strong networks and success.** For e.g., Bill Gates
got introduced to an IBM executive through his mother - which led to Microsoft
getting the DOS contract.

* Study by sociologist Randall Collins of the University of Pennsylvania showed
that breakthroughs were consequence of a particular type of personal network
with very few exceptions.

* Advantages
  - **Private Information.** Provides information arbitrage but reliability may
be an issue.
  - **Diverse set of skills.** Increases diversity and exposure to ideas that'll
help with creativity.
  - **Power.** Traditional executive power moved from hierarchy to information
brokers. *I don't understand this point.*


* Advantages might work against each other. **Diagnose network.** Does your
network fall in either catergory?
  - **Self-similarity principle.** People who are similar to you.
  - **Proximity principle.** People who you spend most time with.


* Create your network based on **SHARED ACTIVITIES.** For e.g., non-profits, 
running group.

* Cultivate powerful **brokers who aren't in position of formal authority.**
