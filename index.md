Hi!

![photo](/assets/photo.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%" align="center"}

I work at Google, leading a team working on Local & Travel verticals (think of queries like [restaurants near me] or [hotels in Goa]) on Google.com. Previously I used to lead the Sports (queries like [ipl] or [liverpool fc] or [olympics]) vertical on Google.com. I'm based out of Bangalore where I live with my wife and son.

I studied Computer Science and Engineering at
[IIT Kharagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kharagpur) and have 10+ years of experience.
