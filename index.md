I work at Google. I lead a team working on Local & Travel verticals on Google.com. Think of queries like [restaurants near me] or [hotels in Goa].

Previously I used to lead the Sports (queries like [ipl] or [liverpool fc] or [olympics]) vertical on Google.com.

I'm based out of Bangalore where I live with my wife and son.

I studied Computer Science and Engineering at
[IIT Kharagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kharagpur) and have 10+ years of experience.
